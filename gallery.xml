					Had a nervous breakdown brought on by stress at Merley Towers.
				</p>
				<p>
					MT was a house in Knole Rd, Boscombe, 
					leased about 1937 by Nanna with Aunt Isobel and Uncle Mac.
					Next door was Knole House, former home of 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Bracken">Brendan Bracken</a>.
					Knole House was sold and became a hotel, bought by Mabel Harrison,
					a friend of Nanna’s from the north, who played sax in an all-girl band
					and catered at her hotel for theatricals.
					(Harrison adopted a daughter, Rosemary, and later ran a sweetshop
					in Coalville, Leics.)

					Reg’s mother moved to 8 Upper Terrace Rd, Bournemouth in 1946-7.
					Reg got a job as a trainee manager at the Grand Hotel,
					befriended Dave &amp; Pat Musgrove 
					(whose son Clive was at Pokesdown with Stephen)
					They gave Stephen an Andy-Pandy doll.
					Dave worked at the Trustee Savings Bank and went to 
					work for them in Hobart, Tasmania for some years.
					Returned to England, worked at the TSB in Holdenhurst Rd,
					built a bungalow at Southbourne.
					They have a daughter, Gail.
					Their son Clive, who was at Pokesdown with Stephen,
					is a dentist in Glasgow. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Reg’s sister Sylvia worked at the bar in the Kings Arms in Christchurch.
					His sister Vera and her husband Bert 
					worked for the Atomic Energy Authority at Portland Bill. 
					Kim Philby’s lot tried to get at them: 
					approached them at a bus stop.
				</p>
				<p>
					His mother’s companion, Kath Much, was Scottish. 
					Her husband, a merchant navy captain, took Reg to sea at 14.
					Because of Mrs Much, the whole family went to the 
					<a href="http://www.bournemouthcaledonian.com/">Caledonian Society</a>,
					which is where I met Reg, who had his girlfriend with him.
					Vera &amp; Bert (who were competition dancers) were 
					sullen at not having a chance to show off.

				<p>
					In 1946 we tried to make friends. 
					Went to the Caledonian Society at the Wedgwood Café
					in Albert Rd, Bournemouth. Bit of a clique.
					A new couple, a retired solicitor Anderson and his wife,
					lived towards Ferndown: their daughters Margaret &amp; Phoebe
					were good freinds to me and Nanna.
					The Society had three functions a year: New Year’s Eve, 
					Burns Night and St Andrews’s Day.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nanna had urged me to learn to dance. 
					I went to the Caledonian Society, where Dr Walker trained members
					in Scottish country dancing.  
					I was too late for class, and only in time for practice.
					At 17½ I was the only young person there.
					I was approached by a stranger, and scolded by Nanna when
					I refused to dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					I met Reg when he approached me for a modern dance.
					Suddenly I could dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Years later in Kirkcudbright we celebrated our first year’s
					fund raising for the swimming pool. 
					I danced and my partner was amazed that I could.

				The bouquet suggests a wedding.
				Nanna claimed it was someone else’s,
				but the large bouquet in her hands makes this unlikely.
				The uneasy-looking man on the left would be Frank Mills, Bel’s father.
				He and Nanna were together for 4-5 years but he
				refused to leave his wife and they separated before Bel’s birth.
				Nanna never divulged anything about him and to her death insisted
				to Bel it was “none of her business”.

				From Nanna’s effects.

				The vehicles and clothes suggest the 1920s or 30s; Army uniform changed before 1939.
				Scene is a spacious crossroads with a market cross.
				Shadows on the footpath indicate a garden to the right.
				Down the far road the buildings end after a little way:
				looks like a small town or village on a major road.
				The scale of the buildings perhaps suggests England rather than Scotland.
				The two men in the picture are near to each other and in step
				but otherwise appear mutually oblivious; the uniformed man’s arms
				suggest a march step. 
				Neither man looks at the camera: the shot appears to be candid.
				Perhaps taken by a street photographer,

 				I was going to take mum to see her cousin Mary when she moved to the Cotswolds but covid prevented it. I took mum to see Mary whilst her husband was still alive &amp; they were still living in Maidstone so I guess 20 years ago. I liked them.

				Mary’s sister was Ellen, Ken’s first wife. Mary &amp; Ellen’s mother was Aunt Janet, Nana’s sister. Possibly the one she moved south with to do nursing training. Mary &amp; Ellen were some of mum’s cousins who she holidayed with in Norfolk. Euphemia (Phemie) was Nana’s eldest sister who brought up her young siblings when their mother (our great-grandmother) died. Phemie then had mum to live with her for the first (7?) years of her life until mum went to live with Nana. Pat (cousin to mum) lived in Selkirk and had Nana to visit – there’s a photo of them both at St Mary’s Loch where I sometimes swim. Pat’s son is Peter who still lives in Selkirk; I’m now in contact with. He’s 70 and Ian &amp; I have been cycling with him.

				I heard on Fri evening that my good friend of 40 years, Desmond in Hong Kong, had died on 15th Feb. I’ve been concerned for several weeks that he hadn’t responded to my messages then I checked his Facebook page again and saw RIP messages. Absolutely devastated and in shock for 24 hours. You may remember he came over from HK just for my 40th birthday party at Centreparc. I visited him in HK twice, lastly with Ian in 2017.

				2019-09-14 
				I took Mum to visit her friend Bunty yesterday. You may remember Bunty? She’s now 101 and moved from Abbeyfield Twyford a couple of months ago to a new Abbeyfield near Southampton Airport which offers higher levels of care (at a much higher cost!). Her eyesight is reducing and she can no longer sort her medication herself, hence her move. The new place is more like a hotel, very nice but I think Mum is currently better off where she is, for now anyway.

				2019-01-21:
				Mum has been doing her exercises 4 times a day, giving me text updates daily when done. Physio is pleased with her progress, has doubled her reps and her increased movement is evident. She has been using the ice-packs on her shoulder but now they are no longer needed.

				Next step will be when mum can manage to undress without the carer and she is nearly ready for that if she chooses the clothes carefully. She can’t put anything on over her head as her arms don’t go up very high currently. The physio says the arm and shoulder joint are ok, the muscles need to get stronger.

				She loves her new coat. Lightweight, easy to get on and cosy. Only £39, reduced from £99. Fits well and looks good. She did have gloves on most of the day, just not at end of trip.

				2018-08-28:
				At mum’s request, I took her shopping for a mobility walker today and she got one. We walked through town and it has at least doubled her walking speed, hurrah! I’ve warned her against over confidence whilst she gets used to it. The path down to Cusack House is probably the worst risk! I’ve heard they are planning to re-lay it.

				We went on to lunch at Hilliers Gardens where I took the photo.

				She has it in time for her Sidmouth holiday, starting next Tuesday. Ian &amp; I are taking her down but staying in a different part of town and largely having separate holidays – have one day out together and a meal. Her hotel is right on the promenade and the cafes and shops are a few steps away.
