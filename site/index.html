				He and Nanna were together for 4-5 years but he

				Nanna never divulged anything about him and to her death insisted

				My mother found this photo in my grandmother’s collection and sent it to Bel

				From Nanna’s effects. 
				Subjects unknown, one in uniform, the other in street clothes. 
				The vehicles and clothes suggest the 1920s or 30s; Army uniform changed before 1939.
				Scene is a spacious crossroads with a market cross.
				Shadows on the footpath indicate a garden to the right.
				Down the far road the buildings end after a little way:
				looks like a small town or village on a major road.
				The scale of the buildings perhaps suggests England rather than Scotland.
				The two men in the picture are near to each other and in step
				but otherwise appear mutually oblivious; the uniformed man’s arms
				suggest a march step. 
				Neither man looks at the camera: the shot appears to be candid.
				Perhaps taken by a street photographer, 
				who might reasonably have hoped to be paid by the soldier.

<p class="note">Caroline: 
 				I was going to take mum to see her cousin Mary when she moved to the Cotswolds but covid prevented it. I took mum to see Mary whilst her husband was still alive &amp; they were still living in Maidstone so I guess 20 years ago. I liked them.

				Mary’s sister was Ellen, Ken’s first wife. Mary &amp; Ellen’s mother was Aunt Janet, Nana’s sister. Possibly the one she moved south with to do nursing training. Mary &amp; Ellen were some of mum’s cousins who she holidayed with in Norfolk. Euphemia (Phemie) was Nana’s eldest sister who brought up her young siblings when their mother (our great-grandmother) died. Phemie then had mum to live with her for the first (7?) years of her life until mum went to live with Nana. Pat (cousin to mum) lived in Selkirk and had Nana to visit – there’s a photo of them both at St Mary’s Loch where I sometimes swim. Pat’s son is Peter who still lives in Selkirk; I’m now in contact with. He’s 70 and Ian &amp; I have been cycling with him.

I’ve been concerned for several weeks that he hadn’t responded to my messages then I checked his Facebook page again and saw RIP messages. Absolutely devastated and in shock for 24 hours. You may remember he came over from HK just for my 40th birthday party at Centreparc. I visited him in HK twice, lastly with Ian in 2017.

				At mum’s request, I took her shopping for a mobility walker today and she got one. We walked through town and it has at least doubled her walking speed, hurrah! I’ve warned her against over confidence whilst she gets used to it. The path down to Cusack House is probably the worst risk! I’ve heard they are planning to re-lay it.

				We went on to lunch at Hilliers Gardens where I took the photo.

				She has it in time for her Sidmouth holiday, starting next Tuesday. Ian &amp; I are taking her down but staying in a different part of town and largely having separate holidays – have one day out together and a meal. Her hotel is right on the promenade and the cafes and shops are a few steps away.

				I took Mum to visit her friend Bunty yesterday. You may remember Bunty? She’s now 101 and moved from Abbeyfield Twyford a couple of months ago to a new Abbeyfield near Southampton Airport which offers higher levels of care (at a much higher cost!). Her eyesight is reducing and she can no longer sort her medication herself, hence her move. The new place is more like a hotel, very nice but I think Mum is currently better off where she is, for now anyway.

				2019-01-21:
				Mum has been doing her exercises 4 times a day, giving me text updates daily when done. Physio is pleased with her progress, has doubled her reps and her increased movement is evident. She has been using the ice-packs on her shoulder but now they are no longer needed.

				Next step will be when mum can manage to undress without the carer and she is nearly ready for that if she chooses the clothes carefully. She can’t put anything on over her head as her arms don’t go up very high currently. The physio says the arm and shoulder joint are ok, the muscles need to get stronger.

				She loves her new coat. Lightweight, easy to get on and cosy. Only £39, reduced from £99. Fits well and looks good. She did have gloves on most of the day, just not at end of trip.
